excerpt: Bye Octopress, welcome Jekyll!
---

I&rsquo;ve moved to Jekyll for a more simpler blogging experience. Octopress is great but I needed something more simpler.

I&rsquo;m busy working on theming my site these. You can checkout my site&rsquo;s [source](https://github.com/rishabhsrao/rishabhsrao.github.io). Development using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) has been great so far.
