Sometimes, Microsoft Office Outlook fails to start and throws a tantrum saying,




"Cannot start Microsoft Office Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window."




Now what do you do? :(




Well, there's a simple solution:




1. Just click Start > Run  

2. Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane




And you're good to go!
