Mounting an ISO image as a drive is simple:

    
    mkdirÂ <strong><path-to-where-you-want-to-mount></strong>
    sudo mount -o loop <strong><your-image.iso></strong> <strong><path-to-where-you-want-to-mount></strong>


That's it! Your ISO image will now be mounted and available at the above path.
