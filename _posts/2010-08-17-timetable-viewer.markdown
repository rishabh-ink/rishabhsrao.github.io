Hi folks!

Here's a Timetable Viewer Flash application created by me! Download the files from GitHub to get started. Just visit [http://github.com/rishabhsrao/Time-Table-Viewer/downloads](http://github.com/rishabhsrao/Time-Table-Viewer/downloads) and download the SWF and the XML files.

There are three files in there, one is the SWF application and the other one is the XML database file. The XML file acts as the data provider.

So just edit the XML file using your favorite text editor, change the values according to your time table and save it.

Open the SWF file and you have a handy time table viewer!

Enjoy!
