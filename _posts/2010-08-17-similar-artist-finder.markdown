Have you ever wanted to expand your taste in music? I mean, say you like Taylor Swift (I do!) and wanted to find out about more artists, who are similar to Taylor Swift. This is where my newest web mashup application comes in - Similar Artist Finder!

To have a look at my application, just pay a visit to [Similar Artist Finder on Kenai.com](http://kenai.com/downloads/similarartistfinder/SimilarArtistFinder.html). The Kenai servers are slightly slow, so you might have to wait for a while until the page loads.

What the application does is very simple. Think of it like a conversation between you and my application:


**App:** Hi! Who is your favorite artist?




**You:** Oh, it’s Taylor Swift; I absolutely love her!




**App:** Great! Hey, you know what, you may also like Gloriana, Carrie Underwood,
Kellie Pickler, Colbie Caillat and Lady Antebellum! Enjoy!




**You:** Wow, I didn’t know about those artists! I’ll start listening to their
songs too! That way, I can expand my taste in music! Thank you so much!
That’s an awesome app!




**Me:** You’re welcome and thank you too!


If you're wondering what technologies I've used to make my mashup, then here's the list:

I'll shortly be writing a step-by-step tutorial about how I built this application! So all my fellow newbie web developers can benefit!
