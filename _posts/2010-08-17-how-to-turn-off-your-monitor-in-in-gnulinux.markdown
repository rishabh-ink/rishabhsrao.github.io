Here's a handy tip to turn off your monitor and to save electricity & save the environment:

Just type

    
    xset dpms force off
    


in your shell!

This works with most operating systems, such as openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora etc. In other words, systems running the [X Window System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).

If you're running KDE + openSUSE 11.2 (like me!) then you can also create a button in your taskbar to do the above!

Here's how:



	
  1. Right-click on your **KDE Kickoff Application Launcher**.

	
  2. Select **Menu Editor**.

	
  3. In the categories displayed on your left, right-click **System** and select **New Item...**.

	
  4. When asked for a name, enter **Turn Off Monitor**.

	
  5. To your right, in the **General** tab, in the **Description** textbox, enter **Puts your monitor in standby mode**.

	
  6. Add a **Comment** if you fancy.

	
  7. Select an icon for your button by clicking the big button with the question mark.

	
  8. My personal favorite is theÂ [![preferences-web-browser-shortcuts](http://rishabhsrao.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/turn-off-monitor.png)](http://rishabhsrao.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/turn-off-monitor.png) icon; but you can select any icon you fancy.

	
  9. To select my favorite icon, under the **Icon Source** select the **System icons **radio button, select **Applications** in the combo-box and search for **preferences-web-browser-shortcuts **and click **OK** (if necessary.)

	
  10. In the **Command** text-box, type **xset dpms force off**.

	
  11. Click on the **Advanced** tab and notice that the **Current Shortcut Key** has a **None** button.

	
  12. Click on that **None** button and press & hold the **Meta** (i.e. Windows) key and (while still holding it) press the **` **(back-quotes or the tilde) key. After you release both the keys, the key shortcut **Meta + `** should be visible instead of **None**.

	
  13. You're done! Just click **Save** on the **KDE Menu Editor**'s toolbar and close the window.

	
  14. The **Turn Off Monitor** menu command will now feature in the **Kickoff **> **Applications** > **System **menu.

	
  15. You can now:

	
    * Right-click on it and select **Add to Favorites**.

	
    * Drag and drop it onto your taskbar. (Be sure your KDE Plasma widgets are unlocked.)
