I'm currently doing stuff with CSS these days at work and I thought of documenting my research here a bit.

I was using [{less} CSS](http://lesscss.org/) for a while now; but slowly ran into limitations. Mainly because it doesn't distinguish between CSS classes and mixins. I'm now using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) and it's really powerful.

The next thing I wanna share is: [css3please.com](http://css3please.com). Pretty cool - created by [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com).

Next we have [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon). It's a library of SCSS mixins. It's based on Ruby, so it installs as a gem. For all you {less} fans, check out [lesselements.com](http://lesselements.com).

Another cool one is [Prefixr](http://prefixr.com) - it helps you easily add all those vendor-specific CSS prefixes.

If you're into CSS grids, then this lightweight grid will definitely appeal to you: [1kbgrid.com](http://1kbgrid.com/). For more power, look at [Twitter Bootstrap's grid](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#gridSystem).

Well, that's about it for now. I'll add more stuff as I find out.

Thanks for reading and hope this helps!
