excerpt: Have you ever wondered where the Close button (&times;) originated?
---
The popular Close button, &times;, originated from the [NeXT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT) operating system's <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> back in the early &rsquo;90s.

Here is a screenshot from [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)&rsquo;s [article on the WorldWideWeb browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb). The WorldWideWeb was the world&rsquo;s first web browser and editor.

> At the time, the "X" close box was unique to NeXT, before Windows copied it.
> The broken X in the "Tim's home page" window means that the document has been edited and not yet saved. (A "dirty" flag).
> As a convenience, pressing Command/Shift/S would save back all modified web pages.
