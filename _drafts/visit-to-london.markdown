excerpt: My experiences of traveling to London.
---
This spring I got an opportunity to travel to London, UK. I opted for a direct flight to London operated by British Airways. It's a pretty long flight from Bangalore, India; takes about 10 hours. My flight was at 8am so I had to get up very early in the morning; I got up at around 3am!
